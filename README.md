#Project Information:
It's a simple data processing system for now. Focused on providing proper risk analysis depending on the condition. 
It's features include a disaster warning system and risk analysis program. It's currently built on JAVA and uses the swing framework for the GUI.
Has a loading screen with two dfiffernt themes for the main UI.
Main UI includes data entry points with a guide on what kind of data and a part where the output is given.
The map is a place holder for now which will later be replaced with a voxel based dynamic mapping system. once everything is ported to rust or C++.

# Also includes Light and Dark mode It is a very important fearture trust me.

Roadmap:

Further Development will only continue once everything has been ported.

1. Porting the code to Rust
2. Adding a dynamic voxel based mapping system.
3. Looking into Machine learning with CUDA for more complex analysis of early warning systems.
